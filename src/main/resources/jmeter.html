Microsoft does not provide end-user device support.</div><div>For Exchange ActiveSync, certain features (such as Direct Push technology, remote wipe, or device security settings) require Windows Mobile 6.1, 6.0, or 5.0 with the Messaging and Security Feature Pack (MSFP) and an active Exchange ActiveSync policy.&nbsp;</div><div>Exchange ActiveSync is only available for customers subscribing to the Exchange Online 1D and 2D plans.</div><div>BlackBerry Devices</div><div>See BlackBerry Device Connectivity description within Optional Service Features section below for more information.&nbsp;</div><div>Macintosh Clients&nbsp;</div><div>Exchange Online supports two email clients developed by Microsoft for the Apple Macintosh operating system.</div><div>Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011</div><div>Microsoft Entourage 2008 for Mac, Web Services Edition</div><div>Both clients use Exchange Web Services to communicate with Exchange Online.</div><div>Customer Responsibility&nbsp;</div><div>Procure, deploy, manage, and support client software and compatible devices.</div><div>Limit</div><div>Exchange Web Services message size limit is restricted to 10 MB.</div><div>POP3 and IMAP4</div><div>Exchange Online supports both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols. Internal customer network POP3 and IMAP4 access is enabled by default and requires encryption using SSL. Internet access to these protocols is blocked.</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Manage per-mailbox protocol settings using remote Windows PowerShell.&nbsp;</div><div>Limitations&nbsp;</div><div>Exchange Online does not support connectivity from external Internet clients.</div><div>Delegated logon is not supported.</div><div>For outbound email, the SMTP client must authenticate over an encrypted channel via Transport Layer Security (TLS).</div><div>SMTP Relay</div><div>The primary mail protocol that is used by Exchange Server is SMTP. Transport servers use SMTP for routing and delivery. Exchange Online supports two types of SMTP relay services for authorized internal customer applications that require SMTP mail submission:</div><div>SMTP message submission to users inside the managed environment.</div><div>Authenticated SMTP message relay to addresses outside the managed environment.</div><div>Customer Responsibilities&nbsp;</div><div>Provide IP addresses of authorized source servers.</div><div>Manage and implement necessary changes in the customer environment to allow mail flow from the customer environment to the Exchange Online environment.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>IP addresses for authorized source servers are required to allow SMTP relay.&nbsp;</div><div>Application Connectivity&nbsp;</div><div>Applications that use messaging protocols such as MAPI, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 are allowed to connect to Exchange Online.

Applications that use MAPI in Online mode are more prone to network-related issues, and Microsoft does not provide escalation or troubleshooting support for these applications.</div><div>Exchange Web Services message size is restricted to 10 MB.</div><div>Exchange Web Services Application Permissions</div><div>Exchange Online enables Exchange Web Services functionality by granting application permissions to customer accounts. These permissions allow the customer application to access the application mailbox and add content. Exchange Impersonation is one method used to grant application permissions.</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Identify the account that is to be granted impersonation rights.&nbsp;</div><div>Microsoft Responsibility</div><div>Grant the provided account impersonation rights.&nbsp;</div><div>Self-Service Administration</div><div>Exchange Online provides customer administrators with the capabilities and tools to manage a variety of messaging-related tasks.</div><div>Exchange Control Panel&nbsp;</div><div>The Exchange Control Panel (ECP) provides self-service administration capabilities through its Web-based management interface that is accessible from Outlook Web App. The following capabilities are available to IT professionals and can be delegated to end users if desired.</div><div>Message tracking. Through ECP, end users and IT professionals who have been assigned the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) permissions can track delivery receipt information, which helps reduce one of the most common help desk calls. End users can track messages they have sent and received and IT professionals can track all messages that are delivered to the Exchange Server 2010 environment.</div><div>Multi-Mailbox Search. Compliance and security officials assigned appropriate RBAC permissions can search a variety of mailbox items including email, attachments, calendar appointments, tasks, and contacts through ECP. Rich search capabilities include searching for information in the sender, receiver, message type, sent/receive date, and cc/bcc fields. Search results include items in the Deleted Items folder if they match the search query. Results of multi-mailbox searches are stored in a special type of mailbox called a discovery mailbox. A discovery mailbox has a 50 GB quota, which makes it capable of storing large numbers of search results. Administrators can connect Outlook to a discovery mailbox and export the search results to a .pst file. In Exchange Online, administrators cannot directly export mailbox search results to a .pst file. By default, one discovery mailbox is created for each organization but administrators can request additional discovery mailboxes through the standard change request process. Discovery mailboxes cannot be used for any purpose other than storing mailbox search results</div><div>Remote device wipe. With this ECP feature, users can manage the process of remotely erasing lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised mobile devices.</div><div>ActiveSync device management. Using ECP, administrators can carry out a variety of tasks related to Exchange ActiveSync mobile phones and devices. These tasks include:&nbsp;</div><div>Manage the default access level for all mobile phones and devices.</div><div>Set up email alerts when a mobile phone or device is quarantined.</div><div>Personalize the message that users receive when their mobile phone or device is either recognized or quarantined.</div><div>Provide a list of quarantined mobile phones or devices.</div><div>Create and manage Exchange ActiveSync device access rules.</div><div>MailTips. With this feature, informative messages are displayed to users while they are composing a message. These informative messages, which provide information about the recipient to help avoid non-delivery reports (NDRs), can be configured using ECP.</div><div>Mailbox Auditing Reports. Audit logging records specific actions performed by specific users. Non-owner audit logging can be used to maintain a record of all changes made to recipient objects by users other than the mailbox owner. Audit logging may help your organization comply with regulatory and legal requirements. Mailbox auditing reports can be run from the Auditing tab in the Exchange Control Panel or Remote PowerShell. Three types of audit reports are available:&nbsp;</div><div>Non-Owner Mailbox Access Report - Use this report to find mailboxes that have been accessed by someone other than the person who owns the mailbox. You can also use this report to determine if mailbox data in your cloud-based organizations is being accessed by Microsoft datacenter personnel.</div><div>Run a Litigation Hold Report - Use this report to find mailboxes that were put on or removed from litigation hold.</div><div>Run an Administrator Role Group Report - Use this report to search for changes made to administrator role groups.</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Set up and control access to security groups used to manage role-based access control (RBAC) permissions for ECP access and to run auditing report features.</div><div>Microsoft Responsibility</div><div>Grant role-based access to customer security groups.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Multi-Mailbox Search works only with mailboxes in the Exchange Online environment.</div><div>Multi-Mailbox Search does not search user PST files.</div><div>The discovery mailbox, where search results are stored, is limited to 50 GB in size.</div><div>Multi-Mailbox Search cannot search content of messages encrypted using S/MIME or Information Rights Management (IRM). Encrypted messages are returned as failed items if the user selects the option to include failed items in search results.</div><div>Message tracking only provides information for message flow within an organization&apos;s Exchange Online environment. When messages are delivered to outside mail systems, the message is listed as transmitted but there is no visibility into its subsequent delivery status.</div><div>Non-owner audit logs are retained for 90 days.</div><div>Mailbox Environment Viewing and Reporting</div><div>Exchange Online makes available a mailbox â€œview-onlyâ€ user role to customer administrators. This role is accessed through the remote Windows PowerShellÂ® command-line interface and enables self-service viewing and reporting of the customerâ€™s messaging seats. The view-only role does not allow the administrator to read the contents of messages in mailboxes.</div><div>User Schedule Availability</div><div>During the coexistence phase of an Exchange Online deployment, Exchange Online synchronizes data concerning user schedule availability between a single customer source and Exchange Online. This step ensures that users can retrieve schedule availability from both the customer and Exchange Online environments.&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Responsibility&nbsp;</div><div>Create an account and grant credentials in the customer environment to enable user schedule availability. Documentation describing configuration steps will be provided to the customer.&nbsp;</div><div>Limitations&nbsp;</div><div>Synchronization is allowed from a single forest or IBM Lotus Domino domain.</div><div>Synchronization requires representation of objects in both the customer and Exchange Online environments.</div><div>The minimum synchronization frequency between the customer and Exchange Online environment is every 15 minutes.</div><div>Synchronization is supported for Exchange Server, Lotus Notes, and Lotus Domino.</div><div>Exchange Server customer environments must provide user schedule availability data on computers running Exchange Server 2007. User schedule availability data on computers running Exchange Server 2003 or earlier versions of Exchange Server is not supported.</div><div>Message Transport Limit</div><div>Message transport size limits are necessary to avoid having large messages block delivery of other messages and affecting service performance for all users. These limits are applied organizational-wide and cannot be configured on per user basis.&nbsp;</div><div>Email sent from the Exchange Online environment to recipients inside or outside the customerâ€™s intranet can have a total message size of up to 50 MB (including attachments).&nbsp;</div><div>Address Book View Customization (Address Lists)</div><div>Exchange Online provides the ability to configure customized views (address lists) in the Outlook Address Book.</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Submit requests to address lists using the change request process.&nbsp;</div><div>Microsoft Responsibility</div><div>Implement requested customer changes to address lists.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Customization of the Outlook Details Template is not permitted.</div><div>Customers are limited to the Exchange custom attributes when adding Address Book fields.&nbsp;</div><div>Address Lists are not added to the Offline Address Book (OAB).&nbsp;</div><div>Transport Rule Configuration</div><div>Exchange Online provides the ability to manage transport rules using remote Windows PowerShell capabilities. Available commands are provided upon request.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Transport rules cannot be deleted due to restrictions in place with the role-based access control (RBAC) role. Rules can be disabled.</div><div>Disclaimer Support</div><div>Customers may be required by law or other regulatory requirements to provide disclaimers within email between recipients and senders both inside and outside the organization. Exchange Online provides disclaimers to meet these compliance requirements.&nbsp;</div><div>Default Settings</div><div>Global disclaimers can be applied to all messages sent to the Exchange Online environment.</div><div>Global disclaimers can be applied to all messages sent from the Exchange Online environment.</div><div>Scenario-specific disclaimers that are defined in customer requirements can be applied separately from global disclaimers.</div><div>Scenario-specific disclaimers are scoped based on distribution group membership.</div><div>Disclaimer text uses default font, size, and color settings of Exchange Server.</div><div>Disclaimers are appended below the entire message thread for all outgoing messages.</div><div>Disclaimers include a line separator between the message content and the disclaimer.</div><div>If the disclaimer cannot be added in the original messageâ€”as with encrypted messagesâ€”a new message is created with the disclaimer, and the original message is attached to the new message.</div><div>Customer Responsibilities</div><div>Define requirements regarding disclaimers including any scenario-specific requirements, if applicable.</div><div>Define and manage distribution groups for scenario-specific disclaimers.</div><div>Define and configure disclaimer content, including text in all desired languages, for all applicable distribution groups.&nbsp;</div><div>Set up and control access to security groups to allow role-based access.</div><div>Microsoft Responsibility</div><div>Configure and implement customer-provided disclaimers as part of the initial Exchange Online deployment.&nbsp;</div><div>Grant role-based access to customer security groups.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Configuration of up to thirty (30) customer-provided disclaimers is allowed for initial deployment.</div><div>Font type, color, and size apply only in HTML and rich-text messages. Plain-text messages have disclaimers that also appear in plain text.</div><div>Exchange Online does not support the following in disclaimers:</div><div>Text greater than 1,000 characters</div><div>Active Directory related queries other than distribution group inclusion</div><div>Images (including logos)</div><div>Exchange Online does not provide language translation services for disclaimers.</div><div>Disclaimers are not programmatically localized.</div><div>Users do not see disclaimers in the messages in the Sent Items folder because the disclaimers are appended by the server after messages are sent by the users. If a user is a member of multiple distribution groups that are used for specific disclaimer scenarios, the userâ€™s outgoing messages display multiple disclaimers.</div><div>Records Management</div><div>Exchange Online supports the use of the messaging records management (MRM) features in Exchange Server to help organizations reduce the liabilities that are associated with email and other communications.&nbsp;</div><div>MRM makes it easier to keep messages that are needed for compliance with company policy, government regulations, or other needsâ€”and to remove content that has no business value. This is accomplished through the use of retention policies and tags.&nbsp;</div><div>Retention policies and retention tags are part of the MRM technology. Retention policies use retention tags to apply retention settings to e-mail messages and folders. Retention tags define an age limit that specifies how long items are retained and a retention action that specifies what happens to items that reach the retention age limit. Retention tags are linked to a retention policy, which is then applied to a mailbox.</div><div>All MRM tasks are managed directly by the customer by using remote Windows PowerShell. Details are described in the Messaging Records Management v2.0 Feature Guide available only dedicated plan customers of Exchange Online.&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Responsibilities</div><div>Create and manage retention polices.</div><div>Create and manage retention tags. Link retention tags to retention policies.</div><div>Assign mailboxes to retention policies.</div><div>Set up and control access to security groups to allow role-based access permissions for self-service features.</div><div>Validation and testing of all policies to be implemented</div><div>Recovery of any data deleted by an incorrect policy</div><div>Microsoft Responsibilities&nbsp;</div><div>Grant role-based access to customer security groups.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Conversion of MRM managed folders to retention policy tags is not supported.</div><div>Office 365 Support does not provide restoration of items deleted as a result of retention policies.</div><div>A mailbox cannot have both an MRM 1.0 policy and an MRM 2.0 policy assigned to it at the same time.</div><div>Multiple Language Support</div><div>Exchange Server provides multiple language packs that provide a localized experience in Outlook Web App and Outlook for Exchange Online users. The availability of languages may differ between Outlook Web App and Outlook. For the current list of languages, see Client Language Support for Outlook and Client Languages for Outlook Web App at Microsoft TechNet.&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Deploy language packs to users.</div><div>Microsoft Responsibility</div><div>Install available server-side language packs.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Microsoft customer support is available in the English language only.</div><div>Antivirus Support</div><div>All messages that are transported through Exchange Online are scanned for viruses. If a virus is detected, the virus is deleted and the message is then delivered to the recipient. A notification of the virus detection is sent to the sender and/or recipient of the message. The optional Message Filtering functionality (removal of spam and malware) is provided by the Microsoft Forefrontâ„¢ Online Protection for Exchange (FOPE) product described in the Optional Service Features section below.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Notifications are sent only to Exchange Online senders who are sending mail within the Exchange Online environment.</div><div>Blocked File Types</div><div>Particular types of email attachments from non-trusted sources are blocked from entry into the Exchange Online environment. Customers can extend the list of blocked attachment file types through the Office 365 change request process.</div><div>Secure Messaging and Encryption&nbsp;</div><div>Exchange Online supports a variety of messaging security solutions. These solutions can be integrated with existing customer solutions for encryption and security.</div><div>S/MIME Certificate Support</div><div>Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is a standard for public key encryption and signing of email that is encapsulated in MIME. Exchange Online provides support for S/MIME certificates by synchronizing certificate information from the customer environment to the Exchange Online environment as part of Active Directory synchronization.&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Provide support and infrastructure for S/MIME to allow item-level security.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Exchange Online does not provide antivirus or other content management services (such as including the message body text of an S/MIME message in multi-mailbox searches) for messages encrypted using S/MIME.</div><div>S/MIME in Outlook Web App is not supported.</div><div>Information Rights Management Support</div><div>Exchange Online supports transfer of email and attachments that are protected with customer-owned Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) systems. For more information about this feature, see the Information Rights Management Integration section of this document.&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Manage the AD RMS infrastructure and client integration.</div><div>Message Encryption</div><div>Exchange Online provides SSL or TLS encryption for all Outlook Web App, Exchange ActiveSync, Outlook Anywhere, IMAP4, and POP3 connections.&nbsp;</div><div>Deleted Item Retention</div><div>Exchange Online provides deleted item retention, which allows users to restore items from any folder including the Deleted Items folder. Users can perform this recovery themselves using Outlook Web App or Outlook. Utilizing the Deleted Item Retention feature eliminates the need for a mailbox restore.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>The deleted item retention period is 30 days and is not configurable by the customer</div><div>Deleted Mailbox Retention</div><div>Exchange Online retains mailboxes for a period of time after they have been deleted. Deleted mailboxes can be recovered by placing a service request with Office 365 Support or, under certain circumstances, automatically through the directory synchronization process. Changes to the default mailbox retention period can be requested through the Office 365 change request process.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>The default deleted mailbox retention period is 30 days. After that time, deleted mailboxes cannot be recovered.</div><div>Mailbox Data Protection and Recovery</div><div>Continuous replication of mailbox data to multiple servers provides data recovery capability in the event of a local messaging infrastructure failure. For large-scale failures, established service continuity management processes are initiated.</div><div>Limitations&nbsp;</div><div>Data restoration limits are defined in the Deleted Item Retention and Deleted Mailbox Retention sections of this document.</div><div>Service Continuity Management&nbsp;</div><div>Exchange Online is hosted in enterprise-level Microsoft data centers that are designed to deliver highly available and highly resilient online services. Because of this design, Exchange Online is available at 99.9 percent uptime.</div><div>Circumstances including hardware failures, natural disasters, and human error can impact service availability. To address this concern, Exchange Online offers service continuity management, a process for managing risks to ensure that the Office 365 IT infrastructure is capable of providing continuing services if normal availability solutions fail.&nbsp;</div><div>Two metrics commonly used in service continuity management to evaluate disaster recovery solutions are:&nbsp;</div><div>Recovery point objective (RPO). The acceptable amount of data loss at the conclusion of the data recovery process.</div><div>Recovery time objective (RTO). The acceptable amount of time the service can be down before being brought back online.</div><div>Exchange Online dedicated plans have set the following RPO and RTO in the event of a disaster:</div><div>45-minutes RPO: In the event of a failover to a secondary data center, Exchange Online restores a copy of customer data that is equal to or less than forty-five (45) minutes old at the time of service disruption.</div><div>Two-hour RTO: Customer services will resume within two (2) hours after disaster declaration is made to failover from the primary to secondary data center.</div><div>Standard services restored with service continuity management are core mail (Exchange Online mailboxes), client access services (Outlook Web App, Windows Mobile), transport, and delegated administrative controls through ECP and remote Windows PowerShell. Optional services included are BlackBerry Enterprise Server and Message Archiving. For an overview of service continuity measures applied across all services of Office 365 for enterprises, please see Service Continuity Management for Enterprises - Dedicated Plans Service Description.</div><div>Customer Responsibilities<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></div><div>Update internal and Internet DNS records and other name records that point to Exchange Online resources, such as mail gateways and mobile messaging URLs.</div><div>Update targets and costs of the mail routing connectors.

However, Microsoft is responsible for and can control only a portion of the elements that combine to provide the total experience for Office 365 users. For example, Microsoft provides services from a global network of Microsoft data centers. It is not responsible for the network connections to the data centers, the customerâ€™s wide area network (WAN), and the customer&apos;s local area networks (LANs). In addition, Microsoft does not control the user device and its configuration. All of these factors have significant effects on the user experience.&nbsp;</div><div>To help customers monitor areas that are not under Microsoftâ€™s direct control, Microsoft reports on a set of service usage metrics and key performance indicator (KPIs). Usage metrics provide customers with information about service usage patterns and activities. KPIs provide information that Microsoft uses as part of its continuous service improvement. The information may also be of use to customers in evaluating aspects of service for which they are responsible. Microsoft measures and reports the same KPIs for all customers.&nbsp;</div><div>Usage Metrics</div><div>The following usage metrics are reported monthly to Exchange Online customers:</div><div>Number of mailboxes by type.</div><div>User detail report that lists every mailbox, along with its display name, email address, optional services enabled for the user, mailbox size, current mailbox capacity, and last logon information.&nbsp;</div><div>Average mailbox size.</div><div>Email summary report that includes email traffic count and email traffic volume (applicable only to customers using message filtering).</div><div>Key Performance Indicators</div><div>The following performance metrics are available to Exchange Online customers:</div><div>Exchange Availability (client). Measures the total percentage of successful RPC client/server operations completed between Outlook and Exchange Online during the month.&nbsp;</div><div>Client Performance. Measures the percentage of successful RPC client/server operations between Outlook and Exchange Online that complete in two seconds or less.&nbsp;</div><div>Mailflow Latency. Measures the percentage of local and remote mailflow transactions that are received within 20 seconds from one Exchange site to all other Exchange sites during the month.&nbsp;</div><div>SMTP Total Messages Received. Measures the total number of messages received by the Exchange Online environment inbound from the Internet during the month. This number does not include messages filtered by other message filtering services prior to entering the Exchange Online environment.</div><div>Messaging Service Availability. Measures the percentage of uptime that the Exchange Online service was accessible to end users during the month.</div><div>Average Mailbox Size (MB). Measures the average size of mailboxes (in MB) for the customer as of the last day of the month.</div><div>Number of SLA Impacting Outages. Provides the total number of service outages per month that impacted the Service Level Agreement (SLA).</div><div>Microsoft Forefront Scan: Total Messages Purged. Measures the total number of messages purged from the Exchange Online environment during the month from antivirus scanning.&nbsp;</div><div>Two Factor Authentication Server Availability. Percentage of successful two-factor authentications during the month.</div><div>Optional Service Features</div><div>The following sections describe optional features that are available with the Exchange Online service. Please note the following:</div><div>As of the April 2011 service update to Exchange Online, the Public Folders feature (including the cross-forest migration and synchronization of public folder content and support for the Organizational Forms Library) is no longer offered with new deployments of Exchange Online.</div><div>Personal Archiving, a feature of Exchange 2010, is not offered within Exchange Online.</div><div>Message Filtering</div><div>The message filtering service offered by Exchange Online provides Internet email filtering through Microsoft Forefrontâ„¢ Online Protection for Exchange (FOPE). This filtering solution provides enterprise-class reliability for messaging security and management and also protects against spam and malware. By default, the antivirus features available in FOPE are enabled. Exchange Online message filtering includes these features:&nbsp;</div><div>Internet traffic filtering. Inbound Internet email traffic is routed through FOPE where each message is evaluated against predefined rules. Outbound Internet email traffic routing through FOPE is an optional service configuration that is not subject to spam filtering rules.</div><div>Encryption. TLS encrypts SMTP traffic in three ways:&nbsp;</div><div>Opportunistic inbound&nbsp;</div><div>Opportunistic outbound&nbsp;</div><div>Required outbound (optional)</div><div>Safelist aggregation and recipient lookup. These two features function when Exchange Online is authoritative. Exchange Online becomes authoritative when all customer mailboxes have been migrated to the Exchange Online environment.</div><div>Message quarantine. Spam filtering uses a quarantine for messages marked as spam. User notification email messages provide access to quarantined email messages. User access to the spam quarantine can also be enabled through the FOPE Administration Center.</div><div>Filtering management and reporting. The FOPE Administration Center provides the customer with the ability to configure policy rules and access reports on key performance indicators of the message filtering service.</div><div>Administration Center web console. Two accounts are provided for access to the FOPE Administration Center: the administrator account and quarantine account.

Recipients must be members of a customer-managed distribution group to be journaled to the SMTP target of the customerâ€™s choice. No other integration methods will be provided.&nbsp;</div><div>Litigation Hold</div><div>Exchange Online provides customers with the ability to leverage the Exchange 2010 litigation hold feature. . Litigation hold, also known as legal hold, is commonly used in scenarios where a reasonable expectation of litigation exists and customers are required to preserve electronically stored information such as email that is relevant to the case. Litigation hold is applied by the customer to specific mailboxes in their organization.&nbsp;</div><div>When a user mailbox is placed on litigation hold, copies of deleted or edited email items are captured and retained in a litigation hold store for discovery and/or recovery. Items captured under litigation hold cannot be altered by the customer.</div><div>Litigation hold also includes these capabilities:</div><div>A customized notification banner can be created to alert users that they are under litigation hold (requires Outlook 2010).&nbsp;</div><div>Self-service administration enables a customer administrator to add and remove users from litigation hold.</div><div>Scheduled reports sent directly to a distribution group established by the customer, which includes the total number of mailboxes on litigation hold, a listing of all mailboxes on litigation hold, the current size of the mailbox and the date the mailbox was configured for litigation hold.&nbsp;</div><div>All litigation hold tasks are managed directly by the customer by using remote Windows PowerShell or the Exchange Control Panel (ECP). Details are described in the Litigation Hold Feature Guide available only dedicated plan customers of Office 365 for enterprises.&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Add and remove users from litigation hold using self-service Remote PowerShell or ECP features</div><div>Customize notification banner to alert users that they are under litigation hold (optional)</div><div>Create and provide a distribution group to Exchange Online for use with Litigation Hold reporting</div><div>Microsoft Responsibilities</div><div>Configure roles for the self-service functionality</div><div>Configure reporting per customer</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Each customer is allowed a maximum of fifteen (15) percent of all mailboxes to be on litigation hold at one time. This maximum is programmatically enforced and the customer will be unable to add new users to litigation hold once the maximum is reached.</div><div>An Exchange Online Plan 2D subscription is required for each mailbox that is placed on litigation hold.&nbsp;</div><div>To view the customized notification banner users must be on Outlook 2010.</div><div>Information Rights Management Integration</div><div>Information Rights Management (IRM) allows an organization and its users to prevent information leakage by giving them the ability to control the rights that recipients are allowed to have on email messages and attachments.</div><div>Customers are able to integrate their on-premises Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) environment with their customer dedicated AD RMS environment within Office 365. With the use of Microsoft Outlook client applications, customers can utilize Exchange Online to implement IRM functionality to restrict recipient actions such as forwarding a message to other recipients, printing a message or attachment, or copying and pasting message or attachment content.&nbsp;</div><div>Enhanced IRM functionality becomes available when the Trusted Publishing Domain (TPD) keys of the&nbsp;</div><div>on-premises AD RMS environment are imported into the customer dedicated AD RMS cluster within Office 365. The existence of the TPDs enables the Office 365 AD RMS cluster to issue use licenses for content protected by another AD RMS cluster. In addition, the following functionality will become available within Exchange Online:</div><div>Ability to view IRM-protected messages within Outlook Web App using Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome Web browsers.</div><div>IRM support for Exchange ActiveSync devices.</div><div>Indexing of IRM-protected messages to support Search.&nbsp;</div><div>Following decryption of content protected using IRM on-premises, Office 365 specific transport protection rules and AD RMS rights policy templates can be applied to emails in transit.</div><div>Ability to scan messages for malware&nbsp;</div><div>Journal report decryption for legal and regulatory purposes.</div><div>A full description of the IRM feature can be found within the Identity and Provisioning Service Description â€“ Office 365 Dedicated Plans.&nbsp;</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Protected Voicemail (associated with Unified Messaging) and Outlook Protection Rules are not supported.</div><div>Not all features are supported in coexistence scenarios; specific limitations are described in supplemental Feature Guide.&nbsp;</div><div>Customers can set up and manage AD RMS on-premises without sharing TPD keys; however, there are functionality limitations with this configuration.&nbsp;</div><div>Issues arising from the use of IRM feature functionality (including the generation of non-delivery reports (NDRs) due to the AD RMS service being unavailable or due to the customer removal of rights policy templates) will not impact the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Exchange Online.&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Responsibility</div><div>Manage AD RMS infrastructure and client integration.</div><div>To take advantage of all IRM capabilities of Exchange Online, the customer must share TPD keys for use within Office 365. The sharing of TPD keys is optional.</div><div>Message Archiving</div><div>For customers with advanced compliance requirements, Exchange Online provides a FISMA-accredited archiving service operated by Proofpoint. This add-on service automatically captures internal and external communications that flow through Exchange Online and then stores them in an encrypted form at a separate archiving data center operated by Proofpoint. With the Proofpoint service, messages are captured and preserved before they arrive in the inbox. Only mailboxes that are enrolled in archiving will have their data available from the archiving data center.&nbsp;</div><div>The Proofpoint archiving service provides the ability for individual users and authorized administrators to access the archived messages. The customer creates and maintains configuration options for its archiving policies, and grants control over who can access the archive. The customer has the ability to own and maintain a distribution group of all mailboxes that are intended for archiving.</div><div>Default Features</div><div>When message archiving is chosen, the following features are standard and enabled by default:</div><div>Administrative search. The archive administrator can run either a basic or advanced search on archived messages. Email is searchable by a customer-defined set of users.</div><div>Flexible policy engine. The customer can create and update retention policies at its discretion. Each retention policy can be configured to consider criteria such as the parties involved and keywords or phrases in the content or file types attached. As each message is archived, it is evaluated against the active set of retention policies.&nbsp;</div><div>Encryption. Email is protected through encryption when in transit and at rest in the archive. All mail or search parameters that are sent to the archive are encrypted, and results back from the archive are unencrypted when they return to Exchange Online.</div><div>Export. Users who are authorized to export and have access to the archive are able to export messages to a .PST file.&nbsp;</div><div>Online storage. Multiple copies of messages are stored online at all times for redundancy purposes.</div><div>Historical user tracking. The administrator can search the archive for all users, including users who may have been deleted from the directory.</div><div>Active legal hold system. With rule-based capture and management of retention hold, the archive administrator can define preservation orders, and the system can capture mail automatically based on the definition of the hold. This feature also allows delegation of access to a specific legal hold rather than to the entire archive.&nbsp;</div><div>Optional Features</div><div>Legacy archiving import. This feature adds the ability to migrate from various legacy archiving systems. Maintaining a single archiving system helps the customer eliminate the extra time and cost of maintaining a separate legacy system.&nbsp;</div><div>Supervision. Users can be put under "supervision," where automatic workflows require that a certain percentage of the mail of those users be reviewed.</div><div>End-user access. This feature enables users to search the archive.</div><div>Discovery Segmentation. Provides logical separations of archived messages based upon division or business unit. Discovery users then can be assigned responsibility for search and legal hold management for these repositories.</div><div>Customer Responsibilities</div><div>Set up and maintain access permissions and perform archive administrative tasks, including search and export.</div><div>Set up and maintain group membership for user access to archive search and export. Any significant changes in the volume of users who access the archive need to be communicated to the Exchange Online team.</div><div>Set up and maintain retention policies.&nbsp;</div><div>Maintain a DNS entry that points to the archiving web user interface.</div><div>Store encryption key offsite.</div><div>Limitations</div><div>Archiving scope is limited to the data sent and received by Exchange Online mailboxes.&nbsp;</div><div>Archive access is not available on the Internet.</div><div>Outbound Desktop Fax</div><div>Users can send faxes via Outlook. Faxes are sent to a third-party carrier for transmission via a secure Internet connection.</div><div>Customer Responsibility&nbsp;</div><div>Provide and deploy customer-specific templates for outbound faxes.</div><div>Limitations&nbsp;</div><div>Exchange Online outbound faxes are available only with Microsoft Office applications.&nbsp;</div><div>Exchange Online outbound faxes do not integrate with Outlook Web App.&nbsp;</div><div>Outbound faxes are available only with 32-bit client computers due to current application constraints.</div><div>Inbound/Outbound Fax Integration</div><div>Exchange Online can integrate with the customerâ€™s existing fax solution, for solutions that allows fax routing via SMTP.</div><div>Customer Responsibility&nbsp;</div><div>Configure the existing fax service for integration with Exchange Online.</div><div>Configure Outlook clients to allow for sending of faxes.</div><div>Microsoft Responsibility&nbsp;</div><div>Provide SMTP transport.</div><div>Two-Factor Authentication for Outlook Web App</div><div>Typical authentication practices that require only a password to access resources may not provide the appropriate level of protection for information that is sensitive or vulnerable. Two-factor authentication is an authentication method that applies a stronger means of identifying the user. It requires users to submit two of the following three types of identify proofs:</div><div>Something known (such as a password)&nbsp;</div><div>Something possessed (such as a smart card)</div><div>Something unique about the user&apos;s appearance or person (such as a fingerprint)</div><div>For an additional fee, Office 365 customers that subscribe to Exchange Online can use existing Swivel PINSafe or RSA SecurID two-factor authentication methods that they have implemented to authenticate to messaging resources that are exposed with Outlook Web App. The customer&apos;s Outlook Web App users can access Office 365 resources via two-factor authentication whenever they connect from outside of the corporate network. Users are not required to use two-factor authentication when within their corporate network.</div><div>How It Works</div><div>Two-factor authentication to Outlook Web App is administered through a dedicated HTTPS URL namespace. This namespace is separate from URL namespaces that are reserved for services that do not require two-factor authentication such as Exchange Web Services and remote procedure call (RPC) over HTTP.&nbsp;</div><div>When an Outlook Web App user accesses resources that are protected by two-factor authentication, the user is presented with the two-factor authentication challenge in addition to the standard username and password combination that is typically used to access the resource.
